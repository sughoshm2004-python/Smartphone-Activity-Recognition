# Smartphone-Activity-Recognition
This repository offers a modular machine learning pipeline for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone sensor data. The har_classifier.py script automates the process from data ingestion to model evaluation, supporting classifiers like Random Forest, KNN, and SVM. It's an excellent educational tool for data scientists and students.
